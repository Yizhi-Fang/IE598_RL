## MARL Lunar Lander
I added GYM folder that is a clone of the original GYM with some modification.
The simplest way to make it working, just put https://github.com/osipychev/IE598_RL/tree/master/gym/gym
into your working folder like "workdir/gym/env".
The other way is to install gym from that repo (into a separate conda environment).
If installation to a separate conda env or virtual machine is impossible, the changes can be done to the original GYM installed to the system.
For that, you need to find the location of GYM that you run from and copy the swap ENV folder.
